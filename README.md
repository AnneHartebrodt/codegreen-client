# greenerai-client
Python client for the greenerai webtool

## Functionalities

1. Query the web service providing convienient functions and decorators.
Functions and decorators should be callable individually, meaning for every explicit function there should be a parametrizable decorator which performs the same functionality automatically.

2. Provide workflow interfaces (for nextflow, and potential other frameworks, such as Pytorch, etc)
The workflow interfaces should allow the same functionalitities as in 1) but streamlines to work in a copy-paste manner with the workflow manager.
